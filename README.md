# BKK Futár Java Client

This is a Java-based client I developed as part of a **Java course** at my University. The assignment was to build a desktop application using the **BKK Futár** public transportation system's API.

## ✨ Features

- **Search** – Look up specific routes or stops and see all the relevant details.
- **Journey Planning** – Plan trips between any two locations with the option to choose your preferred travel modes. It shows **multiple itinerary options** with travel times, transfer points, and walking segments.
- **Journey Details** – Everything is clickable! You can click on any stop or route to see departures or the remaining stops along the way.
- **Favorites** – Save your frequently used stops and routes for quick access.
- **History** – Review your previous searches.
- **User Interface** – The UI (built with JavaFX and CSS) is clean and user-friendly.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Java** – Main programming language used for logic
- **JavaFX and CSS** – Used for building the UI
- **BKK Futár API Integration** – The app connects to the official BKK Futár API for real-time public transport data

## 🎓 About the Project

This was developed as a project for the Java programming course at my University. The assignment was to apply what we learned throughout the semester in a practical app that combines API integration, multithreading, GUI design, and OOP principles.
This project was especially exciting for me because I’ve made similar applications before using **SwiftUI**, so it was really cool to try building something like this in **Java**.  
I also really enjoy **UI design**, so working with **JavaFX** gave me a great chance to get creative and experiment with layouts, styles, and user experience.
